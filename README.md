Syr SafeTech Logger
===================

Syr SafeTech Connect Data Logger (Quick & Dirty [for now :-])

Reads the most important data from a [Syr SafeTech Connect][1] leakage protection device and prints it to the console.

Use console redirection to save the data to a file.  
E.g.:
    python3 SyrSafeTechLogger.py > syrData.txt

> Set the IP address of your Syr SafeTech Connect device in the variable *SYR_IPADDR*.
